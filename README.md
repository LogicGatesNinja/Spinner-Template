# Spinner-Template
A game that spins a blank wheel of names before stopping at a random location. Beware though, strange and funny interruptions can occur! This game was meant for its user to label the spinner and come up with their own rules for what the "interruptions" mean for the player that trigger them.

# Interruptions:
Donkey appears on screen and brays

probability: dynamic. Usually appears after 14 spins at the max.

# How to run
Open the spinner.html after all files are properly downloaded into the same directory. Support is not provided for editing the wheel, and one must manually edit and save the wheel in with its previous sizing and negative space to customize.
